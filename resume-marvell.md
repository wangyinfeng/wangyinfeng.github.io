####2014.2  -  now  IBM CDL
Department: Software Defined Network and Virtual Environment  
Position: Staff Software Engineer  
Projects:   

- Routing appliance for DOVE and OpenStack  
 - Project introduction  
IBM DOVE(Distributed Overlay Virtual Ethernet) is an architecture that allows a network engineer to abstract the physical network infrastructure from hypervisor hosts and make network changes in software. Routing appliance is a plugin for IBM DOVE product, itâ€™s used to advertise the routing info to internet, provide interconnections between VMs(virtual machine) in hybrid cloud environment.  
 - My works and achivement  
I was responsible for merging routing protocols (OSPF/BGP) to DOVE, which provides the ability to import and distribute the routing tables, and provides tunnel function(GRE) for these protocols;  
Designed and developed the RESTful APIs for routing appliance, provided northbound interface to the SDN controller (IBM Pinnacle/OpenStack).  
Developed the routing appliance HA(High Availability) feature.  
- DevOps for DOVE     
 - Project introduction  
Could production requires auto deploy, and rapidly produce appliances and services to improve operations performance.  
 - My works and achivement  
I was responsible for the routing and firewall modules, wrote scripts(Python and Shell) to do automatical testing and deploying.  
- Customer support and POC demonstration  
 - POC(Proof Of Concept) for Beijing Unicom;  
 - POC for ICBC Shenzheng;  
 - Provide supports and fix hotsite issues for Suning.

Position: Staff Software Engineer  
Projects:  

- Embedded switch Compass stacking
 - Project introduction  
Stacking is a method of connect two or more physical switch chips to build a larger system that behaves as a single logical entity, to provide high port density, centralized management, redundancy, modularity and flexible, distributed approach for data center network solution.  
 - My works and achivement  
I was responsible for porting stacking feature to the new hardware platform, the new hardware platform based on the MPC8536 CPU and BCM56840 ASIC, the OS is IBM specified Linux(MCP); developed low level device drivers for new transceiver(via I2C), optimized port bit mapping, reduced CPU load by separating transceiver management to new thread, and fixed massive bugs about LACP/STP.

I was responsible for doing modification about the BCM SDK to adapting new hardware platform(from BCM56840 to BCM56846).   
And developed new approach to speed up image file transfer, by using the benefit of the Boardcom HiGig technology to transfer the image files by ATP(Acknowledge Transfer Protocol) instead of socket, image files dispatch time was reduced by 90%.  
And fixed massive bugs related with HW-specified, thread deadlock, CPU spike, CLI, SNMP etc.  
- Heterogeneous switch StockCar  
 - Project introduction   
StockCar is IBM's next generation stacking platform, which is similar to the Cisco's FabricPath solution used in it's UCS product. It provides a simple and flexible way to manage network inside data center, centralizes the management panel with the aggregation TOR switch to control massive access Embedded switch, provides virtualization function based on current hardware.  
 - My works and achivement  
I was the technical leader of China stacking project team, focused on communicate with global team, assisted project manager to do development progress trace and bug fix schedule.  
Was mainly responsible for the FoD(Feature on Demand) feature development, which provide the solution to support dynamic port resource requirement according to the software license installed.  
Was mainly responsible for the image binding development. Heterogeneous hardware platform required different image files for different switches. I worked with global team to bind multiple types of images into single one and decompose the specified image for specified switch member.  
And was mainly responsible for the hitless image upgrade feature development, co-work with global team members to achieve upgrade software without traffic loss.  
And delivered quick response to customer issues, worked with global team to provide solution to hot-site issues. And provide technology training to sales.
