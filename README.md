Personal blog.

Forked from pexcn/JekllLight.
# Tips
- Multi categories:
```
categories:
- ABC
- XYZ
```
- One line space is needed between the normal line and code block


# TODO
- more personalize
- support comments
- Multi categories not look beautiful, words not separated
- not include the date info in the url, only the article name?
- how to show only part of article on index page, not the entire one?
