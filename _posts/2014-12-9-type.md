title: The rule about assignment between different variable types

The **Expert C Programming** section `Reading the ANSI C Standard for Fun, Pleasure, and Profit` said:  
>argument `const char *s` matches parameter `char *p`...but argument `const char **argv` does not match `char **p`.

Do the assignment `argv = p` will make compiler raise warning message such as `assignment from incompatible pointer type`. I've saw such warning many times, but be frankly, not understand why, every time just use explicit cast(`(argv = const char **)p`) to make the compiler comfortable. It's time to dig deep about this issue.

First let's take a look at the following code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
void
pros(const char **p)
{
    printf("%s\n", *p);
    return;
}

int main()
{
    char *a;
    const char *b;

    char **aa;
    const char **bb;

    a = "A";
    b = a;

    aa = &a;
    bb = aa; /*assignment from incompatible pointer type*/

    /*argument pass is actually assignment*/
    pros(aa); /*assignment from incompatible pointer type*/

    /*Promise the value of 'c' cannot be modified through the symbol 'c', but may be modified by other means, better to call 'read-only'*/
    const char c = 'X'; 
    char *p;
    /* if the following assignment is legal, the 'c' is not const anymore */
    const char **pp = &p;
    *pp = &c;
    *p = 'Y';
    printf("%c\n", c);

    return 0;
}
```

It's legal and normal to do the assignment `const char *b = char *a`, according to the C speficication:
>Both operands are pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of compatible types, and the type pointed to by the left has all the qualifiers of the type pointed to by the right.

The `const char *b` has all the qualifiers of `char *a`, and plus the `const`, so the `const char *b` can **contain** the `char *a`.
But **compatibility of pointer types is not transitive(or recursively)**, only at the top level.  
For example, the `c` is a const variable, it's value is `X` and should not be allowed to changed. If allow `const char **pp = &p`, make change to the `c` via pointer `p` is allowed also, but the intention of the `pp` is to promise the variable it referred to is const, the assignment break the promise and introduced unexpected result.
