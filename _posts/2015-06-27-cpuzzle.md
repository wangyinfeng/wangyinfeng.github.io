##Issue 1

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
    while(1)
    {
        fprintf(stdout,"hello-out");
        fprintf(stderr,"hello-err");
        sleep(1);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

You cannot see the "hello-out" print on the stdout, only has "hello-err".

**Analyse**
Output to stdoutis often buffered by the system, try `fflush()` or use "hello-out\n" to implicitly flush the buffer.
While to stderr is often not buffered.
