title: The collection about my personal tools
category:

Time to go, and time to collect the useful tools I got in the past years.

The best way maybe have a VPC or VM or Container to have all tools installed, and can be synchronized between different place, and can be copied/moved to anywhere, so this duplicated work doesn't need to do everytime when change the workstation or job.(Of course I don't want to change the next job too quickly)
