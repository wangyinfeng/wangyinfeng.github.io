```c
void main()
{
    char s[] = "abcde";
    s += 2;
    printf("%c\n",s[0]);
}
```
**Analyst**
The 's' here is array name, array name is not a variable, it's type is `char[6]`, not a pointer.
It's no way to get the `c` character by assign array name `s` the new value, you can do it by `s[2]` or `*(s+2)`.
The array name stand for **array** when use operate `&` or `sizeof`, otherwise it's stand for the address of the first array element.
