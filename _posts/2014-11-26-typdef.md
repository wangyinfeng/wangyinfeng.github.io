title: Why use or not use the typedef
category: C

Surprise to hear that should **never** use the `typedef`.

#Pros of `typedef`
- Hide opaque object  
**Real** opaque object, cannot be accessed directly, such as `pte_t`.  
Clear integer types, such as `U8/U16/U32`.  
- Saving your calorie

#Cons of `typedef`
- Global namespace pollute  
When have `typedef struct foo {...} FOO`, the `FOO` is exploit to the global namespace.`Really? I can have the same variable name and compile ok`
- Abuse hide the detail of objects  
Explain from `Kernel Coding Style`:  
>In general, a pointer, or a struct that has elements that can reasonably be directly accessed should **never** be a typedef.
