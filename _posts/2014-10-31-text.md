title: Pointer as function parameter

```c
void GetMemory(char *p)
{
    p = (char *)malloc(12);
}

int main(void)
{
    char *str = "Hello";
    GetMemory(str);
    strcpy(str,"Hello World");
    printf("%s",str);

    return 0;
}
```
**Analyst**
 - It's not about `str` has not enough space to contain the `Hello World`.
 - It's not about `GetMemory()` not allocate enough space.
It's about pointer as function's parameter, it's only **give** it's value to the function, not it's **address**, so when `GetMemory()` assign the heap space to the `p`, it's not change the `str`'s value.
And it's about the `str` pointe to a address the belong to `.rodata`, and not allow to **write**.
